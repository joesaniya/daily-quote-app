## 🏗️ Architecture

The app follows a clean, layered architecture pattern:

```
lib/
├── models/              # Data models
│   └── quote.dart
├── services/            # Business logic & API calls
│   ├── quote_service.dart
│   └── favorites_manager.dart
├── providers/           # State management (Provider pattern)

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

This project was built leveraging modern AI coding tools to accelerate development and maintain code quality.

### AI Tools Used

1. **Claude Code** (Primary)

   - Architecture planning and code generation
   - Complex logic implementation
   - Refactoring and optimization

2. **GitHub Copilot / Cursor**

   - In-editor code completions
   - Quick fixes and suggestions
   - Boilerplate generation

3. **ChatGPT / Claude**
   - Problem-solving and debugging
   - Documentation writing
   - Code review and improvements

### Development Workflow

#### Phase 1: Planning & Design

```
AI Prompt: "Design a Flutter app architecture for a daily quotes app
with favorites, sharing, and offline support. Use Provider for state
management and suggest the best project structure."
```

#### Phase 2: Model & Service Layer

```
AI Prompt: "Create a Quote model class for Flutter that handles JSON
from ZenQuotes API. The API returns {q: 'text', a: 'author'}. Include
null safety, equality operators, and serialization methods."
```

#### Phase 3: State Management

```
AI Prompt: "Implement a QuoteProvider using ChangeNotifier that fetches
quotes from an API service, handles loading states, errors, and includes
a time-based greeting feature."
```

#### Phase 4: UI Implementation

```
AI Prompt: "Create a modern Material 3 home screen for a quotes app with:
- Gradient background
- Animated quote card with fade-in effect
- Action buttons for favorite, share, and refresh
- Bottom navigation bar"
```

#### Phase 5: Local Persistence

```
AI Prompt: "Implement a FavoritesManager service using SharedPreferences
to store Quote objects. Include methods for add, remove, toggle, and
retrieve all favorites with proper error handling."
```

### Effective Prompting Strategies

#### ✅ Good Prompts

- **Specific**: "Add a dismissible gesture to remove favorites with an undo snackbar"
- **Context-rich**: "The API sometimes returns null. Update the Quote.fromJson factory to handle missing fields with fallbacks"
- **Incremental**: "First create the basic UI, then add animations in the next step"

#### ❌ Avoided Prompts

- Too vague: "Make it better"
- Too broad: "Build the entire app"
- Without context: "Fix the error" (without sharing the error)

### AI-Assisted Problem Solving

**Challenge 1: Animation Synchronization**

```
Problem: Multiple animations conflicting on favorite toggle
AI Solution: Suggested using separate AnimationControllers with
proper disposal and sequential animation chaining
```

**Challenge 2: Async State Management**

```
Problem: SharedPreferences causing race conditions
AI Solution: Recommended loading favorites in initState and
using FutureBuilder pattern for initial load
```

**Challenge 3: API Error Handling**

```
Problem: App crashes on network failure
AI Solution: Implemented try-catch with fallback quotes and
user-friendly error messages
```

### Time Savings

- **Manual Coding Estimate**: 12-15 hours
- **AI-Assisted Actual Time**: 4-5 hours
- **Time Saved**: ~70% faster development
- **Code Quality**: Improved with AI-suggested best practices

## Project Guide 📚

All folder-level documentation has been consolidated into this single Project Guide to make it simpler to find information. If you previously looked for per-folder README files, use this section as the authoritative source.

### Models (lib/models)

- Purpose: Data model classes used across the app (e.g., `Quote`, `UserProfile`, `Collection`).
- Notes: Models include `fromJson`/`toJson` helpers, equality, and null-safety handling.
- Example:

```dart
final q = Quote.fromJson(json);
print(q.text);
```

### Services (lib/services)

- Purpose: Business logic, API calls, and platform integrations (e.g., `QuoteService`, `ShareService`, `NotificationService`).
- Notes: Keep UI concerns out of services; return simple results or throw well-documented errors.

### Providers (lib/providers)

- Purpose: State management using Provider + ChangeNotifier (e.g., `QuoteProvider`, `FavoritesProvider`).
- Notes: Unit-test provider logic and use widget tests for UI flows.

### Screens (lib/screens)

- Purpose: Page-level UI and navigation (e.g., `HomePage`, `BrowseQuoteScreen`, `QuoteCardGenerator`).
- Notes: Keep `build` concise and move repeated pieces into smaller widgets.

### Config & Core (lib/config, lib/core)

- Purpose: App configuration helpers (e.g., `SupabaseConfig`) and small utilities (navigation helpers, constants).
- Notes: Avoid putting feature-specific logic here.

### Platform Notes (android, ios, web)

- Purpose: Platform-specific build notes, permissions, and manual integration steps.
- Quick tips:
  - Android: If you see plugin namespace issues prefer upgrading/replacing the plugin; reduce `org.gradle.jvmargs` if the daemon crashes from OOM.
  - iOS: Add Info.plist keys (e.g., `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription`) when interacting with Photos.
  - Web: Some plugins are not supported on web — check compatibility.

If you'd like, I can extract more detailed examples from each folder and add short snippets or a developer quickstart section here.

## New features added

- Collections: create, edit, add/remove quotes (already implemented). ✅
- Quote of the Day: Server-side daily generation and display on the Home screen. ✅
- Local daily notifications: App schedules a daily notification with the Quote of the Day (user-selectable time). ✅
- Deep links: `app` uses `/quote/<id>` route so notifications and widgets can open the app to a specific quote. ✅
- Home widget support: `WidgetService` and `home_widget` are added; platform integration (Android AppWidgetProvider / iOS WidgetKit extension) is required to fully enable the widget. 🔧

If you'd like, I can continue and add the Android `AppWidgetProvider` boilerplate and manifest changes, and the iOS WidgetKit extension with App Group setup in the next PR.
